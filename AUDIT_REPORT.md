## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Fresh Install Test)

### 1. Specific Machine Names Throughout Documentation

**Problem:** Documentation uses "toronto-0001", "toronto-0002", "vivobook" - confusing for new users

**Files Affected:**
- `docs/scaling.md` - All examples use "toronto-" prefix
- `docs/architecture.md` - toronto-0001 references throughout
- `docs/setup-options-guide.md` - "like toronto-0001"
- `docs/operations.md` - "vivobook", "toronto-node-ip"
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` - "toronto-0002"
- `docs/networking.md` - "toronto-001", "toronto-002"
- `GLOSSARY.md` - "toronto-0001"

**Fix Required:** Replace with generic names:
- "toronto-0001" ‚Üí "control-plane" or "node-001"
- "toronto-0002" ‚Üí "worker-001" or "node-002"  
- "vivobook" ‚Üí "your laptop" or "management laptop"

**Impact:** HIGH - Users will copy-paste wrong hostnames

---

### 2. Outdated Installation Flow

**Problem:** INSTALLATION.md mentions old credential file paths

**File:** `INSTALLATION.md` line 302-306
```markdown
> üí° **Password Management:** After installation completes:
> 1. Copy all credentials from `/root/mynodeone-*.txt` to a password manager
> 2. **DO NOT** self-host password manager on MyNodeOne
> 3. Delete credential files: `sudo rm /root/mynodeone-*.txt`
> 
> See `docs/password-management.md` for detailed guide.
```

**Issue:**
- Credentials are NOW auto-deleted after user confirms saving them
- This section contradicts the new flow
- Reference to manual deletion is outdated

**Fix Required:** Update to reflect automatic deletion flow

**Impact:** HIGH - Confuses users about security flow

---

### 3. Missing Quick Start Script Documentation

**Problem:** Users don't know about setup-laptop.sh, deploy-llm-chat.sh in some docs

**Files Affected:**
- `INSTALLATION.md` - Doesn't mention setup-laptop.sh  
- Some older docs don't reference new scripts

**Fix Required:** Add clear pointers to new scripts

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Users miss helpful tools

---

### 4. Inconsistent .local Domain References

**Problem:** Some docs say use IPs, others mention .local domains, but it's not clear this is optional

**Files Affected:**
- Various docs mix IP and .local references
- Not clear that .local setup is optional

**Fix Required:** Clarify when/how .local works

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Users confused about access methods

---

## üü° MODERATE ISSUES (Should Fix)

### 5. create-app.sh Still Referenced

**Problem:** Old workflow still documented but may confuse users who see simpler options

**Files Affected:**
- `README.md` - Shows create-app.sh
- `docs/operations.md` - Lists as "Method 1"
- `DOCUMENTATION-INDEX.md` - References it
- `FAQ.md` - Suggests using it

**Current State:** Script exists and works, but:
- Requires Git setup
- Requires understanding of GitOps
- More complex than demo app

**Fix Required:** 
- Keep script but de-prioritize in docs
- Show demo-app and manage-apps.sh first
- Label create-app.sh as "Advanced"

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Non-technical users may struggle

---

### 6. docs/password-management.md

 Referenced But Contradicts New Flow

**Problem:** File exists but may have outdated info about manual deletion

**Fix Required:** Review and update to match automatic deletion

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Confusing security guidance

---

### 7. enable-security-hardening.sh Timing

**Problem:** INSTALLATION.md says "do this AFTER installation, BEFORE adding workers"  
BUT: Bootstrap now offers it DURING installation

**Files Affected:**
- `INSTALLATION.md` - Step 3

**Fix Required:** Update to say "prompted during install OR run manually after"

**Impact:** LOW - Just outdated, not blocking

---

## üü¢ MINOR ISSUES (Nice to Fix)

### 8. Terminology Consistency

**Problem:** Mixed use of:
- "Control Plane" vs "control plane" vs "control-plane"
- "Worker Node" vs "worker" vs "worker node"

**Fix Required:** Standardize casing

**Impact:** LOW - Cosmetic

---

### 9. Example Commands Use Placeholders

**Problem:** Some commands use `<placeholder>` format, others use actual IPs/names

**Examples:**
- Good: `kubectl get nodes`
- Inconsistent: `ssh <toronto-0001-tailscale-ip>` vs `ssh 100.x.x.x`

**Fix Required:** Consistent placeholder format

**Impact:** LOW - Minor UX

---

### 10. Broken Internal Link (Minor)

**Problem:** Some docs reference "Section X" but sections were renamed

**Fix Required:** Verify all internal section references

**Impact:** LOW - Usually obvious from context

---

## ‚úÖ THINGS THAT ARE GOOD

1. ‚úÖ All script files exist (no broken script references)
2. ‚úÖ Major documentation files exist
3. ‚úÖ POST_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md is comprehensive
4. ‚úÖ SECURITY_CREDENTIALS_GUIDE.md is thorough  
5. ‚úÖ New scripts (setup-laptop.sh, deploy-llm-chat.sh) are well-documented
6. ‚úÖ Error handling in bootstrap script is good
7. ‚úÖ README.md is well-organized

## üéØ EDGE CASES TO TEST

### Script Edge Cases:

1. **setup-laptop.sh:**
   - [ ] What if user doesn't have SSH access to control plane?
