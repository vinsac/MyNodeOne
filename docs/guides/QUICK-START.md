## üí° Tips for Success

### 1. Start Small
- Install 1-2 apps first
- Get comfortable using them
- Then add more

### 2. Use Mobile Apps
- Most apps have excellent mobile clients
- Download from official app stores
- Much better experience than mobile browsers

### 3. Bookmark Your Addresses
- Create bookmarks for your apps
- Or set `http://mynodeone.local` as homepage

### 4. Share with Family
- Family members can access apps too
- Just give them the web address
- They create their own accounts

### 5. Regular Backups
- Longhorn (your storage system) has automatic snapshots
- But still backup important data manually
- See [docs/backup-guide.md](docs/backup-guide.md)
