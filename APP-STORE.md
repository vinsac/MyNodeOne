# MyNodeOne App Store

## 🎯 Overview

MyNodeOne now includes a built-in **App Store** with one-click installations for popular self-hosted applications. Non-technical users can easily deploy powerful applications to their personal cloud without writing any code.

## 🌐 How Do You Access Apps?

**Great News!** Every app gets an **easy-to-remember address** automatically:

```
jellyfin.mynodeone.local    ← Your Netflix-like media server
immich.mynodeone.local      ← Your Google Photos backup
vaultwarden.mynodeone.local ← Your password manager
nextcloud.mynodeone.local   ← Your Dropbox replacement
...and so on!
```

### 🏠 On Your Laptop/Desktop (Local Network)

**Works immediately after DNS setup!** Just type the address in your browser.

**Example:** After installing Jellyfin, open your browser and go to:
```
http://jellyfin.mynodeone.local
```

**Works on:**
- ✅ Your laptop (with DNS configured)
- ✅ Your desktop computer
- ✅ Any computer that ran `setup-client-dns.sh`

### 📱 On Mobile Devices (Requires Tailscale)

**IMPORTANT: Mobile phones and tablets need Tailscale installed**

**Why?** Your apps run on a secure Tailscale network (100.x.x.x IPs). Mobile devices must join this network to access them.

**How to Set Up Tailscale on Mobile (5 minutes, one-time):**

1. **Install Tailscale app**
   - iPhone: App Store → "Tailscale"
   - Android: Play Store → "Tailscale"

2. **Connect**
   - Open app → Login with SAME account as MyNodeOne
   - Tap "Connect"

3. **Done!** Open Safari/Chrome and go to:
   - `http://jellyfin.mynodeone.local` - it just works!

**What you get:**
- ✅ Access apps from anywhere (home, coffee shop, vacation)
- ✅ Encrypted connection (like a personal VPN)
- ✅ Same easy URLs work everywhere
- ✅ No port forwarding or router setup needed
- ✅ Free for personal use!

### 🌐 Public Access (Advanced)

Want to share Jellyfin with family not on your network?

- Set up custom domain (like `movies.yourfamily.com`)
- Requires VPS edge node (~$5/month)
- See EDGE_NODE_GUIDE.md for setup
