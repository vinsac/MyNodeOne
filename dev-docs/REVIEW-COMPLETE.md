## 🔴 Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

### Issue #1: Disk Formatting Data Loss
**Risk:** User could lose important data without warning

**Current Code:**
```bash
mkfs.ext4 -F "$disk" > /dev/null 2>&1  # Silently erases!
```

**Required Fix:**
- Check if disk has existing data
- Show CLEAR WARNING
- Require explicit confirmation (type disk name)
- Don't suppress errors
- Offer to show files first

**Time:** 30 minutes

---

### Issue #2: RAID Safety
**Risk:** Could corrupt existing RAID arrays

**Current Code:**
```bash
mdadm --create /dev/md0 ...  # No check if md0 exists!
```

**Required Fix:**
- Check if /dev/md0 exists
- Check for existing RAID arrays
- Backup mdadm.conf before modifying
- Use different device if md0 in use

**Time:** 20 minutes

---

## ⚠️ Major Issues (Fix Soon)

### Issue #3: Network Connectivity
- No check if internet available
- Confusing errors if network down
- **Fix:** Add ping check before starting
- **Time:** 15 minutes

### Issue #4: Idempotency
- Running script twice causes errors
- No check for existing installation
- **Fix:** Detect existing setup, offer options
- **Time:** 30 minutes

### Issue #5: Resource Validation
- No check for sufficient RAM/disk
- Fails mysteriously on low-spec machines
- **Fix:** Check RAM/disk before starting
- **Time:** 20 minutes

## 🎯 Recommendations

### For You (Project Owner):

**Immediate (Today/Tomorrow):**
1. Review CODE-REVIEW-FINDINGS.md
2. Review DOCUMENTATION-REVIEW.md
3. Decide: Fix now or postpone public release?

**Short Term (This Week):**
1. Implement Phase 1 critical fixes (4-6 hours)
2. Test thoroughly with real data
3. Update documentation per Phase 2

**Medium Term (This Month):**
1. Complete Phase 2 documentation

- [ ] Run with no internet (should show clear error)
- [ ] Format disk with existing data (should warn clearly)
- [ ] Run script twice (should handle gracefully)
- [ ] Interrupt with Ctrl+C (should cleanup)
- [ ] Try with existing RAID (should prevent overwrite)

**User Types:**
- [ ] Complete beginner (no Linux experience)
- [ ] Intermediate (some Docker knowledge)
- [ ] Product manager (reading docs only, no install)
- [ ] Advanced (sys admin, checking code)

**Documentation:**
- [ ] Non-technical person understands
