## üõ†Ô∏è What Does Installation Do?

The `sudo ./scripts/mynodeone` command:

1. **Cleans your system** - Removes unnecessary software to save RAM
2. **Detects external disks** - Finds and offers to configure extra storage
3. **Asks a few questions** - Name, location, what type of computer this is
4. **Secure networking** - Connects your machines safely (using Tailscale)
5. **Application platform** - Installs software to run your apps (Kubernetes)
6. **Storage system** - Sets up automatic backups and file storage
7. **Monitoring dashboard** - Lets you see what's happening in real-time
8. **Automatic deployment** - Apps update when you push to GitHub

**Time:** 30-45 minutes  
**Interaction:** Answer ~5 questions  
**Everything else:** Automatic

> ü§î **Don't understand these terms?** Check the [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md) for simple explanations!

## üåê Networking: Tailscale (Default)

**MyNodeOne uses Tailscale by default** for secure networking between machines.

### What is Tailscale?
- Secure mesh VPN (like a private internet for your machines)
- Each machine gets a private IP (100.x.x.x)
- Works behind NAT/firewalls automatically
- Free for up to 20 devices

### Why Tailscale?
- ‚úÖ **5 minute setup** - fastest option
- ‚úÖ **Zero configuration** - just works
- ‚úÖ **Free for personal use**
- ‚úÖ **Perfect for MyNodeOne** - designed for this

### Installation Handles It
The installation script automatically:
- Installs Tailscale
- Authenticates (opens browser)
- Gets your IP
- Configures everything

**You don't need to do anything!**

### Want Alternatives?
See [docs/networking.md](docs/networking.md) for Headscale, Netmaker, ZeroTier, WireGuard, etc.

**Recommendation:** Stick with Tailscale (default).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety & Common Concerns

### Will this break my computer?
**No.** MyNodeOne only installs software in its own directories. Your personal files and existing setup remain untouched.

### What if something goes wrong?
The script stops if there's an error. Nothing is changed until you explicitly confirm. You'll see what's happening at each step.

### Can I undo the installation?
Yes! You can uninstall MyNodeOne completely. (We'll add an uninstall guide soon.)

### What about my existing files?
MyNodeOne installs to `/opt/mynodeone` and doesn't touch your documents, photos, etc.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** If you choose to format a disk for storage, that disk's data WILL be erased. The script will warn you and ask for confirmation first!

### What if I get stuck?
1. Check [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md)
2. Check [FAQ.md](FAQ.md) - 50+ questions answered
3. Look up error messages in [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md)
4. Open an issue on GitHub

## ‚ùì Quick Questions

**Q: I have no idea what Kubernetes is. Can I still use this?**  
A: Yes! You don't need to understand the technology. Just follow the steps. (But check [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md) if curious!)

**Q: Do I need a VPS?**  
A: No! Only if you want your apps accessible from the public internet. For personal/internal use, Tailscale is enough.

**Q: How much does this cost?**  
A: $0/month for home-only setup. $5-30/month if you add VPS for public access. No hidden costs!

**Q: Can I run this on Windows/Mac?**  
A: The servers need Ubuntu Linux. But your laptop (Windows/Mac/Linux) can manage the cluster via Tailscale.

**Q: How long does setup take?**  
A: 30-45 minutes for first node. Mostly automated - you just answer a few questions.

**Q: Which networking should I use?**  
A: **Tailscale (default)**. It's automatic and just works. Don't overthink it!

**Q: Can I migrate from AWS?**  
A: MyNodeOne IS your AWS alternative! Run the same apps here for 95% less cost.

**Q: What if I don't understand the technical terms?**  
A: Check [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md) - we explain everything in simple language!
