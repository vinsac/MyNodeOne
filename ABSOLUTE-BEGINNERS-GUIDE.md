## üì∫ Step 0: Opening the Terminal

The terminal is where you type commands. Here's how to open it:

### On Ubuntu Desktop:

**Option 1: Keyboard Shortcut** (Easiest)
1. Press `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T` together
2. A black window will open - this is the terminal!

**Option 2: Using the Menu**
1. Click "Activities" in the top-left corner
2. Type "terminal" in the search box
3. Click on "Terminal" when it appears

**Option 3: Right-Click Menu**
1. Right-click on your desktop
2. Select "Open in Terminal" (if available)

**What you'll see:**
```
username@computername:~$
```
This is called the "command prompt" - it's waiting for you to type something!

## üìã Copying and Pasting Commands

### In the Terminal:

**‚ùå DON'T use Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V** (these mean something different in terminal!)

**‚úÖ DO use these instead:**

**To Copy:**
- Highlight text with your mouse
- Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `C`
- OR right-click and select "Copy"

**To Paste:**
- Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `V`
- OR right-click and select "Paste"
- OR middle-click your mouse (on some systems)

**Pro Tip:** You can also right-click in the terminal for a menu!

## üîê Understanding `sudo` and Passwords

### What is `sudo`?

**Simple explanation:** `sudo` means "run this command as administrator"

**Why needed:** Some commands need permission to modify system files (like installing software).

### What Happens When You Type `sudo`?

1. You type: `sudo apt update`
2. Press Enter
3. Terminal asks: `[sudo] password for username:`
4. **Type your password** (the one you use to log into Ubuntu)
5. **IMPORTANT:** You won't see anything as you type the password - this is normal!
6. Press Enter

**It's like this:**
```bash
$ sudo apt update
[sudo] password for john: ‚ñã         ‚Üê cursor, but no visible text!
```

**Why can't I see my password?**
- It's a security feature!
- The computer IS receiving your typing
- Just type carefully and press Enter

```

### 3. `git clone https://github.com/vinsac/MyNodeOne.git`

**What it does:** Downloads MyNodeOne code to your computer  
**Like:** Downloading a ZIP file and extracting it  
**Time:** 5-30 seconds  
**Creates:** A folder called "MyNodeOne" in your current location

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vinsac/MyNodeOne.git
# Output:

**Like:** Double-clicking a folder to open it  
**Time:** Instant  
**You'll see:** Your prompt changes to show you're in MyNodeOne

```bash
cd MyNodeOne
# Before: username@computername:~$
# After:  username@computername:~/MyNodeOne$
```

### 5. `sudo ./scripts/mynodeone`

**What it does:** Runs the main MyNodeOne installer  
**Time:** 30-45 minutes
