# Tailscale Headless Setup (VPS/CLI Only)

**Quick guide for setting up Tailscale on servers without GUI**

---

## üéØ For VPS/Cloud Servers (No Desktop UI)

Your VPS has **no graphical interface** - everything is done via SSH terminal. Here's how to set up Tailscale:

---

## Method 1: Interactive Authentication (Easiest)

### Step 1: Install Tailscale on VPS

```bash
# On your VPS (via SSH):
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
```

### Step 2: Start Tailscale

```bash
sudo tailscale up
```

### Step 3: Authenticate via Browser

**You'll see output like:**
```
To authenticate, visit:
  https://login.tailscale.com/a/1234567890abcdef
```

**What to do:**
1. **Copy that URL**
2. **Open it on your laptop/phone browser**
3. **Log in to Tailscale** (or create account)
4. **Click "Connect"** to approve the device
5. **Done!** Your VPS is now on Tailscale

### Step 4: Verify Connection

```bash
# On VPS - check Tailscale IP
tailscale ip -4

# Example output: 100.101.102.103

# Check full status
sudo tailscale status

# You should see your VPS listed
```

**That's it!** Your VPS now has a Tailscale IP (100.x.x.x) that you can use to access it and any apps.

## Method 2: Auth Key (No Browser Needed)

**For automation or if Method 1 doesn't work:**

### Step 1: Generate Auth Key

**On your laptop:**
1. Go to https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys
2. Click "Generate auth key"
3. Check "Reusable" and "Ephemeral" (optional)
4. Click "Generate key"
5. **Copy the key** (starts with `tskey-auth-...`)

### Step 2: Use Auth Key on VPS

```bash
# On your VPS:
sudo tailscale up --authkey=tskey-auth-YOUR-KEY-HERE
```

**Done!** No browser needed.

### Step 3: Verify

```bash
tailscale ip -4
sudo tailscale status
```

---

## Method 3: Manual Device Approval

### Step 1: Start Tailscale Without Auth

```bash
sudo tailscale up --force-reauth
```

### Step 2: Approve on Admin Panel

1. Go to https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines
2. Find your VPS (shows as "waiting for approval")
3. Click "Approve"
4. Done!

## üîç Checking if Tailscale Works

### From VPS:

```bash
# Get your Tailscale IP
tailscale ip -4

# Example: 100.101.102.103

# Check status
sudo tailscale status

# Ping another device (if you have one)
ping 100.x.x.x
```

### From Your Laptop:

1. **Install Tailscale** on laptop (https://tailscale.com/download)
2. **Log in** with same account
3. **Check status:**
   ```bash
   tailscale status
   ```
4. **Ping your VPS:**
   ```bash
   ping 100.101.102.103  # Use your VPS Tailscale IP
   ```

### From Your Phone:

1. **Install Tailscale app** (iOS/Android)
2. **Log in** with same account
3. **You should see your VPS** in device list
4. **Can now access it** via 100.x.x.x

## üåê Using Tailscale IPs

### Access VPS via Tailscale:

**SSH (more secure than public IP):**
```bash
# Instead of:
ssh root@45.8.133.192

# Use:
ssh root@100.101.102.103  # Your Tailscale IP
```

**Access apps:**
```bash
# Immich running on VPS
http://100.101.102.103

# Dashboard
http://100.101.102.103:8080

# Any Kubernetes service
http://100.101.102.103:<port>
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Encrypted automatically
- ‚úÖ No port forwarding needed
- ‚úÖ Works from anywhere
- ‚úÖ No firewall changes needed
- ‚úÖ Access from phone/laptop/tablet

**Fix:** 
```bash
# Restart Tailscale
sudo tailscale down
sudo tailscale up

# Check if running
sudo systemctl status tailscaled
```

### Issue: "Can't ping between devices"

**Fix:**
```bash
# Enable IP forwarding on VPS
echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p

# Restart Tailscale
sudo tailscale down
sudo tailscale up
```

## üîê Security Tips

### 1. Disable Key Expiry (Optional)

By default, auth keys expire. To disable:
1. Go to https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys
2. Generate key with "No expiry" checked

### 2. Use Tailscale ACLs

Control which devices can access what:
1. Go to https://login.tailscale.com/admin/acls
2. Configure access rules
3. Example: Only allow your laptop to SSH to VPS

### 3. Enable MagicDNS (Recommended)

Access devices by name instead of IP:
1. Go to https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns
2. Enable MagicDNS
3. Access VPS via: `ssh vmi2161443` instead of `ssh 100.x.x.x`
