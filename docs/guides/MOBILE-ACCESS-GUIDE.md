## How Tailscale Works

### The Simple Explanation

**Without Tailscale:**
```
Your Phone → Can't reach MyNodeOne
(Different networks, private IPs, no access)
```

**With Tailscale:**
```
Your Phone → Secure encrypted tunnel → MyNodeOne
(Same virtual network, works from anywhere)
```

### What Tailscale Actually Does

1. **Creates Virtual Network**
   - All your devices join a private mesh network
   - Each device gets a special IP (100.x.x.x)

2. **Encrypts All Traffic**
   - Uses WireGuard (modern, audited encryption protocol)
   - Even on public WiFi, your data is safe

3. **Works Everywhere**
   - Home WiFi 
   - Mobile data (4G/5G) 
   - Coffee shop WiFi 
   - Hotel WiFi 
   - Airport WiFi 

4. **No Port Forwarding**
   - Your router stays secure
   - No firewall changes needed
   - Works behind NAT

---

## Security & Privacy

### Is Tailscale Safe?

**Yes!** Here's why:

- **Open Source:** Code is public, independently audited
- **End-to-End Encrypted:** Tailscale can't see your data
- **No Data Collection:** Your traffic doesn't go through Tailscale servers
- **Industry Standard:** Uses WireGuard (state-of-the-art VPN)
- **Zero Trust:** Each device must be explicitly authorized

### What Does Tailscale See?

**They CAN see:**
- Your device list (names you choose)
- Last connection times

**They CANNOT see:**
- Your actual data/traffic
- What apps you're using
- Your files or photos
- Passwords or credentials

**Your data goes DIRECTLY from phone → MyNodeOne.** Tailscale just helps them find each other.

### Cost

**Personal Use: FREE**
- Up to 100 devices
- Unlimited traffic
- All features

**Business Use: Paid plans available**
- Not relevant for home/personal use

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Can't connect to http://mynodeone.local"

**Check #1: Is Tailscale Connected?**
```
Open Tailscale app
Look for "Connected" status
If "Disconnected": Tap to reconnect
```

**Check #2: Are you on the same Tailscale account?**
```
Tailscale app → Settings → Check email/account
Must be SAME account as MyNodeOne uses
If different: Logout and login with correct account
```

**Check #3: Is MyNodeOne online?**
```
In Tailscale app, look for MyNodeOne device
Should show as "Online"
If offline: Check if MyNodeOne machine is powered on
```

---

### Problem: "Tailscale won't connect"

**Fix #1: Reinstall VPN Profile**
```
iPhone:
1. Settings → General → VPN & Device Management
2. Remove Tailscale VPN profile
3. Re-open Tailscale app
4. Tap "Connect" → Allow new profile

Android:
1. Settings → Network → VPN
2. Remove Tailscale
3. Re-open Tailscale app
4. Tap "Connect" → Allow
```

**Fix #2: Check Network**
```
Try switching between WiFi and mobile data
Some public WiFi blocks VPNs
Use mobile data to test
```

**Fix #3: Update App**
```
App Store/Play Store → Updates
Update Tailscale to latest version
```

---

### Problem: "Mobile app can't find server"

**Check #1: Tailscale is running**
```
Swipe down (notifications)
Should see "Tailscale connected" or similar
If not: Open Tailscale app and connect
```

**Check #2: Correct server URL**
```
Common mistakes:
https://immich.mynodeone.local (wrong - no https)
http://immich.mynodeone.com (wrong - .com not .local)
http://immich.mynodeone.local (correct!)

Double-check the exact URL from installation output
```

**Check #3: DNS resolution**
```
Open Safari/Chrome on phone
Try: http://mynodeone.local
If that works, DNS is fine
If not, wait 5 minutes and try again (DNS propagation)
```

---

### Problem: "Works at home but not on mobile data"

**This is normal if Tailscale is OFF!**

**Check:**
```
Open Tailscale app
Is it connected? 
If "Disconnected": Tap to connect
```

**Background App Refresh (iPhone):**
```
Settings → General → Background App Refresh
Enable for Tailscale
This keeps VPN connected
```

**Battery Optimization (Android):**
```
Settings → Apps → Tailscale
Battery → Unrestricted
Prevents Android from killing Tailscale
```

---

## Pro Tips

### 1. Keep Tailscale Running
```
Don't force-quit Tailscale app
Let it run in background
Uses minimal battery (<2%)
Ensures instant access to apps
```

### 2. Use On-Demand VPN (iOS)
```
Tailscale app → Settings
Enable "On Demand"
Automatically connects when needed
Disconnects when not in use
```

### 3. Create Widgets (if available)
```
Tailscale widget shows connection status
Quick access to connect/disconnect
Add to home screen for convenience
```

### 4. Share Access with Family
```
Family members need:
1. Tailscale account (can be their own OR shared)
2. Access granted from admin console
3. Their own accounts on your apps

You control who can access what!
```

### 5. Monitor Battery Usage
```
Tailscale uses ~1-2% battery per day
If higher: Check for app updates
Modern phones handle VPNs efficiently
```

---

## Data Usage

**Good News: Minimal!**

### Tailscale Overhead
- **Connection:** ~1-5KB when connecting
- **Keep-Alive:** ~10-20KB per hour when idle
- **Active Use:** ~2-5% overhead on your data

### Example Scenarios

**Photo Backup (Immich):**
```
Uploading 100 photos (500MB):
Data used: 510MB (2% overhead)
```

**Streaming Movie (Jellyfin):**
```
2-hour movie (4GB):
Data used: 4.1GB (2.5% overhead)
```

**File Sync (Nextcloud):**
```
Syncing 100 documents:
Data used: ~50MB
```

**The overhead is negligible for normal use!**
