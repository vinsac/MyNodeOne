---

## 📦 One-Click App Installation

**New:** Install professional self-hosted applications with a single command

### Interactive App Store
```bash
sudo ./scripts/app-store.sh
```
Beautiful TUI menu with:
- Categorized app listings
- Status indicators (Ready/Coming Soon)
- One-click installation
- View installed apps
- Access information display

### Available Apps (Ready to Use)

**Media & Entertainment:**
- 🎬 **Jellyfin** - Netflix-like media server
- 🎮 **Minecraft** - Game server for friends

**Photos & Files:**
- 📸 **Immich** - Google Photos alternative with AI
- ☁️ **Nextcloud** - Dropbox replacement (coming soon)

**Security & Tools:**
- 🔐 **Vaultwarden** - Password manager (Bitwarden)
- 🏠 **Homepage** - Application dashboard

**Coming Soon:**
- Plex, Mattermost, Gitea, Uptime Kuma, Paperless-ngx, Audiobookshelf

### What Each Script Does

**Automatically:**
1. Creates isolated namespace
2. Deploys database (if needed)
3. Configures persistent storage via Longhorn
4. Assigns LoadBalancer IP via MetalLB
5. Generates secure random passwords
6. Configures DNS (subdomain access)
7. Displays access URL and credentials

**Installation time:** 2-5 minutes per app

**Files:**
- `scripts/app-store.sh` - Interactive menu
- `scripts/apps/install-*.sh` - Individual app installers
- `scripts/apps/README.md` - Developer documentation

---

## 🌐 Subdomain Access (No More IP Addresses!)

**The Problem:** Apps were accessible via confusing IPs like `http://100.64.12.45:8096`

**The Solution:** Every app gets a memorable subdomain:

```
✅ http://jellyfin.mynodeone.local
✅ http://immich.mynodeone.local
✅ http://vaultwarden.mynodeone.local
✅ http://nextcloud.mynodeone.local
```

**How It Works:**
- LoadBalancer assigns Tailscale IP to each app
- Automatic DNS configuration (`configure-app-dns.sh`)
- Updates `/etc/hosts` on control plane
- Generates client setup script for laptops
- Works everywhere via Tailscale

**Port Simplification:**
- All web apps use standard HTTP port 80
- No port numbers to remember!
- Example: `http://immich.mynodeone.local` (not `:3001`)
- Consistent pattern across all apps

**Files:**
- `scripts/configure-app-dns.sh` - Automatic DNS setup
- `setup-app-dns-client.sh` - Generated for client devices
- Apps auto-configure DNS during installation

---

**Setup (5 minutes, one-time):**
1. Install Tailscale app from App Store/Play Store
2. Login with SAME account as MyNodeOne
3. Tap "Connect"
4. Done! Access all apps from anywhere

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Works from anywhere (WiFi, 4G/5G, vacation)
- ✅ Fully encrypted (WireGuard VPN)
- ✅ Free for personal use
- ✅ No port forwarding needed
- ✅ No router configuration
- ✅ Works on cellular data

**Documentation:**
- Complete setup guides in all beginner docs
- Troubleshooting section for mobile issues
- Security & privacy explanation
- Battery usage details

---

## 🎨 Bootstrap Integration

**Enhanced:** Dashboard and DNS deploy automatically during bootstrap

**Changes to `bootstrap-control-plane.sh`:**
- Deploys dashboard after ArgoCD installation
- Calls `configure-app-dns.sh` for DNS setup
- Displays dashboard URL in credentials output
- Integrated into main installation flow

**User Experience:**
```
1. Run bootstrap-control-plane.sh
2. Wait 30 minutes
3. Open http://mynodeone.local
4. See beautiful dashboard with everything ready!
```

## 🛡️ Safety Improvements

### 1. No More Accidental Data Loss! ⚠️

**Before:** Disk formatting happened with minimal warning  
**Now:** You get **multiple confirmations** before any data is erased:

- ✅ Big red WARNING banner
- ✅ Shows what's currently on the disk
- ✅ Option to view files before formatting
- ✅ Must type disk name to confirm
- ✅ Final yes/no confirmation

**Result:** Your important data is protected!

---

### 2. Pre-Flight Checks ✈️

**New:** Before installation starts, MyNodeOne checks:

- ✅ **Internet connectivity** - Fails fast if offline
- ✅ **System resources** - Checks RAM, disk space, CPU
- ✅ **Required tools** - Verifies all dependencies present
- ✅ **Existing installation** - Detects if already installed

**Result:** Catch problems BEFORE they cause issues!

---

### 3. Safe Interrupt (Ctrl+C) 🛑

**Before:** Pressing Ctrl+C could leave system in broken state  
**Now:** 

- ✅ Graceful shutdown
- ✅ Tells you if system is in consistent state
- ✅ Provides recovery instructions if needed
- ✅ Safe to re-run

**Result:** You can safely stop installation anytime!

---

### 4. RAID Protection 🔒

**Before:** Could accidentally overwrite existing RAID arrays  
**Now:**

- ✅ Checks if RAID device exists
- ✅ Shows current RAID configuration
- ✅ Backs up RAID config before changes
- ✅ Clear error if conflict

**Result:** Your existing RAID arrays are safe!

---

### 5. Better Error Messages 💬

**Before:** Cryptic errors like "command not found"  
**Now:**

- ✅ Clear explanations of what went wrong
- ✅ Possible causes listed
- ✅ Step-by-step recovery instructions
- ✅ Relevant commands provided

**Example:**
```
✗ Insufficient RAM: 2GB (minimum 4GB required for control plane)

Your system has 2GB RAM, but control plane requires at least 4GB.

Options:
  1. Add more RAM to this machine
  2. Use this as a worker node instead (requires 2GB minimum)
  3. Use a different machine with more RAM
```

---
