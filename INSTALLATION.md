## üéØ Overview: What You'll Do

**MyNodeOne installation has 3 simple steps:**

1. **Prepare Your Control Plane Machine** ‚Üê Start here! (this section)
2. **Download MyNodeOne** (Step 1 below)
3. **Run the Installation Wizard** (Step 2 below)

The wizard will ask if you want to add more machines (workers/VPS) - you can add them later!

---

## Prerequisites: Prepare Your Control Plane Machine

> üéØ **Start with Your Control Plane (Master Node)**
> 
> **What is it?** Your control plane is the "brain" of your cluster - it manages everything.
> 
> **Why start here?** Once your control plane is ready, it can automatically configure any worker nodes you add later via SSH. You only need to manually prepare ONE machine!
> 
> **Which machine?** Your most powerful/reliable machine (recommended: 8GB+ RAM, but 4GB works for learning).

> üí° **Understanding Command Output:** Not sure if a command worked? Copy the output and ask ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude: "Did this command succeed?" They can help you understand what you're seeing!

### What You Need on Your Control Plane Machine

**Hardware:**
- ‚úÖ At least ONE machine with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS installed
  - **New to Ubuntu?** For installation instructions, refer to the [official Ubuntu installation guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop) or search "how to install Ubuntu 24.04" on ChatGPT, Gemini, or your preferred AI assistant.
  - Can be named anything (e.g., `node-001`, `server-alpha`, `homelab-01`)
  - Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB+ recommended for control plane)
  - Desktop or Server edition works

**Software to install on this machine:**

### 1. Git - For downloading MyNodeOne
   
   **First, open your terminal:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` on Ubuntu Desktop
   - Or see [TERMINAL-BASICS.md](TERMINAL-BASICS.md) for help
   
   **Then run these commands:**
   ```bash
   # Update package list
   sudo apt update
   
   # (Optional) Upgrade system packages - RECOMMENDED for fresh installations
   # WARNING: Skip this on existing/production machines to avoid breaking changes
   # sudo apt upgrade -y
   
   # Install git
   sudo apt install -y git
   ```
   
   **Expected output for successful install:**
   ```
   Reading package lists... Done
   Building dependency tree... Done
   Setting up git (1:2.43.0-1ubuntu7) ...
   ```
   ‚úÖ Look for: `Setting up git` and no error messages
   
   **To verify git installed:**
   ```bash
   git --version
   # Should show: git version 2.43.0 (or similar)
   ```
   
   - For assistance with git installation, consult ChatGPT, Gemini, or search online.

---

### 2. SSH Server - For managing other machines (if you add them later)
   
   **In the same terminal, run:**
   ```bash
   # Install OpenSSH Server:
   sudo apt install -y openssh-server
   
   # Start SSH service (if not already running):
   sudo systemctl start ssh
   
   # Enable SSH to start on boot:
   sudo systemctl enable ssh
   
   # Verify it's running:
   sudo systemctl status ssh
   ```
   
   **Expected output for successful commands:**
   - `sudo apt install -y openssh-server` ‚Üí Should show `Setting up openssh-server` with no errors
   - `sudo systemctl start ssh` ‚Üí No output = success! (silence is good here)
   - `sudo systemctl enable ssh` ‚Üí May show `Synchronizing state...` or nothing = success!
   
   **How to know if it's running:**
   
   ‚úÖ **Good - SSH is running (you'll see):**
   ```
   ‚óè ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server
        Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; enabled)
        Active: active (running) since ...
   ```
   Look for: `Active: active (running)` in **green** text
   
   ‚ùå **Problem - SSH is NOT running (you'll see):**
   ```
   ‚óè ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server
        Loaded: loaded
        Active: inactive (dead)
   ```
   Look for: `Active: inactive` or any **red** text
   
   **If you see "inactive (dead)":** Go back and run the start/enable commands above
   
   **Press `q` to exit the status screen**
   
   - **Why needed:** When you add worker nodes later, your control plane uses SSH to configure them automatically. Each machine needs SSH server so others can connect to it.
   - **Install on workers too:** When you add more machines, you'll install SSH on them as well (same commands).
   - For SSH troubleshooting, consult ChatGPT, Gemini, or search online.

---

### 3. Tailscale - For secure networking between machines
   
   **In the same terminal, run:**
   ```bash
   # Install curl (if not already installed):
   sudo apt install -y curl
   
   # Install Tailscale:
   curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
   
   # Connect to your Tailscale network:
   sudo tailscale up
   # This will:
   # 1. Open a browser window (or show a URL)
   # 2. Ask you to log in with Google, Microsoft, or GitHub
   # 3. Approve this device on your Tailscale network
   # 4. Assign a 100.x.x.x IP address to this machine
   ```
   
   **Expected outputs:**
   - `sudo apt install -y curl` ‚Üí Should show `curl is already the newest version` or `Setting up curl`
   - `curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh` ‚Üí Will show installation progress, then `Installation complete!`
   - `sudo tailscale up` ‚Üí Shows a URL like `https://login.tailscale.com/a/abc123def` - open this in your browser!
   
   **After tailscale up succeeds, you'll see:**
   ```
   Success.
   ```
   ‚úÖ Your machine is now connected to Tailscale!
   - **First time?** Sign up for free at https://tailscale.com before running this
   - **No browser?** Copy the URL shown and open it on another device
   - **Need help with Tailscale?** Ask ChatGPT, Gemini, or see [docs/networking.md](docs/networking.md)
   - **Install on workers too:** When you add more machines, you'll install Tailscale on them as well (same commands).

---

### ‚úÖ Control Plane Machine is Ready!

**You now have:**
- ‚úÖ Ubuntu 24.04 LTS installed
- ‚úÖ Git installed
- ‚úÖ SSH server running
- ‚úÖ Tailscale connected

**What about worker nodes or VPS?**
- üéØ **Add them later!** The installation wizard will ask if you want to add more machines
- üéØ **Worker nodes:** Additional machines in your cluster (optional)
- üéØ **VPS with public IP:** For internet access (optional)
- üéØ **Management laptop:** Any device with kubectl to deploy apps (optional)

**For now, just focus on your control plane machine!**

> **Need Help?** If you encounter any issues following these steps or understanding the commands, feel free to consult ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or other AI assistants for guidance.

## üìç Step 1: Download MyNodeOne (30 seconds)

**On your control plane machine, in your terminal, run:**

```bash
# Clone the repo (choose one method):

# Option 1: HTTPS (easier, no SSH key needed)
git clone https://github.com/vinsac/MyNodeOne.git

# Option 2: SSH (requires SSH key setup)
git clone git@github.com:vinsac/MyNodeOne.git

# Go into the folder:
cd MyNodeOne

# You should now see: yourusername@machine:~/MyNodeOne$
```

**What just happened?**
- ‚úÖ Created a `MyNodeOne` folder in your home directory
- ‚úÖ Downloaded all MyNodeOne code into it
- ‚úÖ Changed into that folder

---

## üöÄ Step 2: Run the Installation Wizard (30 minutes)

**Run this ONE command:**

```bash
sudo ./scripts/mynodeone
```

**What happens next:**
- Asks for your password (it's invisible when you type - normal!)
- Shows welcome screen
- Asks questions about your setup
- Installs everything automatically
- Takes 20-45 minutes

**Just answer the questions and wait!**

**That's it!** The command installs:
- K3s Kubernetes
- Storage (Longhorn + MinIO)
- Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
- GitOps (ArgoCD)
- SSL automation (Cert-Manager + Traefik)
- Security (firewall, fail2ban)

**After completion:**
- Cluster is ready!
- Credentials saved to `/root/mynodeone-*.txt`
- Access monitoring at `https://grafana.mynodeone.local`

---

## üîó Step 4: Add More Machines (Optional)

### Want to Add Worker Nodes?

On each additional machine:

```bash
# 1. Install prerequisites (git, SSH, Tailscale) - see Prerequisites section above
# 2. Download MyNodeOne
git clone https://github.com/vinsac/MyNodeOne.git
cd MyNodeOne
# 3. Run installer
sudo ./scripts/mynodeone
# 4. Select "Worker Node" when asked
# 5. Provide the join token from your control plane (saved in /root/mynodeone-join-token.txt)
```

### Want Public Internet Access?

**Add VPS Edge Nodes:**

On each VPS:

```bash
# Same process as above, but select "VPS Edge Node"
git clone https://github.com/vinsac/MyNodeOne.git
cd MyNodeOne
sudo ./scripts/mynodeone
```

### Configure VPS Edge Nodes

**Then point your DNS to your VPS:**
```
Type  Name  Value           TTL
A     @     <your-vps-ip>   3600
A     www   <your-vps-ip>   3600
```

## Step 5: Setup Management Workstation (5 minutes, optional)

On your **laptop/desktop** for deploying apps:

```bash
./scripts/interactive-setup.sh  # Select option 4 (Management Workstation)
```

**Then install kubectl:**
```bash
# Download kubectl
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl

# Copy kubeconfig from control plane
scp user@<control-plane-tailscale-ip>:/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config

# Edit and replace 127.0.0.1 with control plane IP
sed -i 's/127.0.0.1/<control-plane-tailscale-ip>/g' ~/.kube/config

# Test connection
kubectl get nodes
```

## Step 6: Deploy Your First App

### Option A: Deploy Example LLM (CPU)

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/examples/llm-cpu-inference.yaml

# Wait for model download (one-time, ~5-10 min)
kubectl logs -f job/download-llama-model -n ai-workloads

# Check status
kubectl get pods -n ai-workloads

# Access the LLM API
curl http://<service-ip>/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

### Option B: Deploy Full-Stack App

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/examples/fullstack-app.yaml
kubectl get pods -n myapp
```

### Option C: Create Your Own App

```bash
./scripts/create-app.sh myapp --domain myapp.com --port 3000
cd myapp
# Customize your code
git push
# ArgoCD auto-deploys!
```

## üîí Security Hardening (Recommended)

After installation, enable additional security features:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/enable-security-hardening.sh
```

This adds:
- ‚úÖ Kubernetes audit logging
- ‚úÖ Secrets encryption at rest
- ‚úÖ Pod Security Standards (restricted)
- ‚úÖ Network policies (default deny)
- ‚úÖ Resource quotas
- ‚úÖ Security headers (HSTS, CSP)

**Already Enabled (Automatic):**
- ‚úÖ Firewall on all nodes
- ‚úÖ fail2ban SSH protection
- ‚úÖ Strong 32-char random passwords
- ‚úÖ Encrypted network (Tailscale)

**Important: Password Management**

1. Save all credentials to a password manager (Bitwarden/1Password)
2. **DO NOT** self-host password manager on MyNodeOne
3. Delete credential files after saving: `sudo rm /root/mynodeone-*.txt`

See `docs/password-management.md` for detailed guide.
