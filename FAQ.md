### Is MyNodeOne production-ready?

Yes! MyNodeOne uses battle-tested open-source tools:
- K3s (used by Cisco, Siemens, and thousands of companies)
- Longhorn (enterprise storage by SUSE/Rancher)
- MinIO (trusted by NASA, Intel, and many Fortune 500s)
- Traefik (powers millions of sites)
- Prometheus/Grafana (industry standard monitoring)

### Can I use MyNodeOne for commercial projects?

Absolutely! MyNodeOne is MIT licensed. Use it for your startup, business, or personal projects. All components are free and open source.

## Technical Questions

### What OS do I need?

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Desktop or Server edition). Other Linux distributions may work but are untested.

### Can I run MyNodeOne on just one machine?

Yes! Start with your first node (e.g., `node-001`) and add more nodes later. The architecture scales from 1 to 100+ nodes.

**Note:** Node names like `toronto-0001`, `node-001`, etc. are just examples. You can use any hostname you prefer.

### Do I need fast internet?

Recommended: 100 Mbps upload minimum. With 500 Mbps (like yours), you can serve HD video to 60+ concurrent users from home.

### What if my ISP blocks ports 80/443?

That's why we use VPS edge nodes! They handle public traffic and route to your home via Tailscale on non-blocked ports.

### Can I use MyNodeOne without Tailscale?

Not recommended. Tailscale provides:
- NAT traversal (works behind any router)
- Encrypted mesh networking
- Zero configuration
- Free for personal use

Alternatives like WireGuard require manual configuration.

### How much does it cost to run?

**Hardware:** You already own it ($0/month)
**VPS Edge Nodes:** ~$15/month each (Contabo)
**Domains:** ~$10-20/year
**Electricity:** ~$30-50/month for your control plane node

**Total:** ~$30-50/month vs $2,000+/month on AWS

### What happens if my control plane node goes down?

With 1 node: Everything stops until it's back up.
With 2+ nodes: Apps automatically migrate to healthy nodes.
Solution: Add additional nodes (e.g., `node-002`, `node-003`) for high availability.

### Can I mix different hardware?

Yes! MyNodeOne works with:
- Different CPU architectures (as long as all are x86_64 or all ARM64)
- Different RAM amounts
- Different storage sizes
- Different network speeds

Kubernetes handles scheduling appropriately.

### Does MyNodeOne support GPU workloads?

Not out of the box, but it's on the roadmap. You can manually install NVIDIA device plugin for GPU support.

## Storage Questions

### How does distributed storage work?

Longhorn replicates data across nodes:
- 1 node: 1 replica (no redundancy)
- 2 nodes: 2 replicas (survives 1 node failure)
- 3+ nodes: 3 replicas (survives 2 node failures)

### Can I expand storage later?

Yes! Add more disks to existing nodes via Longhorn UI. No downtime required.

### What's the difference between Longhorn and MinIO?

**Longhorn:** Block storage for databases and stateful apps (like AWS EBS)
**MinIO:** Object storage for files and media (like AWS S3)

Both are needed and complement each other.

### How do I backup my data?

1. Longhorn automatic snapshots (configured in bootstrap script)
2. MinIO replication to another bucket/location
3. K3s etcd automatic snapshots (every 12 hours)
4. Custom backup CronJobs (example included)

## Application Questions

### Can I run Virtual Machines (VMs) on MyNodeOne?

**No, MyNodeOne is container-only** (Kubernetes-based). It does NOT support VMs out of the box.

**Why containers instead of VMs?**
- ⚡ **Faster:** Start in seconds (vs minutes for VMs)
- 💾 **Lighter:** 10-100MB (vs GBs for VMs)  
- 🔄 **Modern:** Better for cloud-native apps, CI/CD, microservices
- 📦 **Portable:** Works everywhere (dev, test, prod)

**"But I need VMs for dev services!"**

Most dev services work BETTER as containers:
- ✅ **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis → All have official Docker images
- ✅ **Dev Tools:** GitLab, Jenkins, VS Code Server → Run as containers
- ✅ **Message Queues:** RabbitMQ, Kafka → Official images available
- ✅ **Testing:** Selenium, test databases → Faster as containers

**When you ACTUALLY need VMs:**
- ❌ Windows applications (use Proxmox instead)
- ❌ Legacy apps that can't containerize (use Proxmox)
- ❌ Testing different OS kernels (use Proxmox)
- ⚠️ **Advanced:** You can add KubeVirt to run VMs on Kubernetes (not included by default)

**Bottom line:** If you primarily need VMs, use Proxmox. If you're running modern apps/services, MyNodeOne's containers are faster and better!

### What apps can I run on MyNodeOne?

Anything that runs in Docker/containers:
- Web apps (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- APIs (Node.js, Python, Go, Java, etc.)
- Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis)
- Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
- ML/AI models
- Game servers
- WordPress, Ghost, etc.

If it has a Docker image, it runs on MyNodeOne!

### How do I deploy my first app?

Three options:
1. Use `create-app.sh` script (recommended for new apps)
2. Apply example manifests: `kubectl apply -f manifests/examples/`
3. Use ArgoCD UI to deploy from Git repos

### Can I use Docker Compose files?

Yes! Convert them to Kubernetes manifests using:
```bash
kompose convert -f docker-compose.yml
```
Or use Kompose directly.

### How does GitOps work?

1. Push code to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions builds Docker image
3. Updates Kubernetes manifest
4. ArgoCD detects change
5. Deploys to cluster automatically

No manual deployments needed!

### Can I run multiple apps with different domains?

Yes! Each app gets its own:
- Namespace
- SSL certificate
- Domain routing
- Resource allocation

Example: curiios.com, vinaysachdeva.com, blog.example.com all on the same cluster.

## Networking Questions

### How does traffic flow from internet to my app?

```
User → VPS (SSL termination) → Tailscale tunnel → Control Plane Node → App Pod
```

### Why use VPS instead of exposing my node directly?

1. **ISP blocks:** Many ISPs block ports 80/443
2. **Dynamic IP:** Home IPs change; VPS IPs are static
3. **DDoS protection:** VPS can absorb attacks
4. **Bandwidth:** VPS has unlimited inbound bandwidth
5. **Latency:** VPS provides edge caching (optional)

### Can I add more VPS edge nodes?

Yes! Run `setup-edge-node.sh` on any VPS and point DNS to it. Load balancing is automatic (DNS round-robin).

### How do SSL certificates work?

1. You point DNS to VPS
2. Traefik on VPS requests cert from Let's Encrypt
3. Let's Encrypt verifies domain ownership (HTTP challenge)
4. Certificate issued automatically
5. Auto-renews every 60 days

Zero manual work!

### Can I use my own SSL certificates?

Yes, but not recommended. Let's Encrypt is free and automatic. If you need custom certs, configure Traefik manually.

## Security Questions

### What security features does MyNodeOne have?

**Automatic Security (Built-in):**
- Firewall (UFW) on all nodes - only allows SSH and Tailscale
- fail2ban protection against SSH brute-force attacks
- All passwords are 32-character random strings (no defaults)
- Credentials stored with chmod 600 (owner-only access)
- Encrypted network traffic (Tailscale uses WireGuard)
- Minimal attack surface (only VPS exposes 80/443)
- RBAC enabled for access control

**Optional Hardening (Run after install):**
```bash
sudo ./scripts/enable-security-hardening.sh
```

Adds:
- Kubernetes audit logging (tracks all cluster operations)
- Secrets encryption at rest in etcd
- Pod Security Standards (prevents privileged containers)
- Network policies (default deny all traffic)
- Resource quotas (prevents DoS)
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, XSS protection)

**Security Documentation:**
- Full security audit performed (0 vulnerabilities remaining)
- Production security guide: `docs/security-best-practices.md`
- Password management guide: `docs/password-management.md`
- Audit report: `SECURITY-AUDIT.md`

### Should I expose my control plane node to the internet?

No! Keep it behind Tailscale. Only VPS edge nodes should have public IPs.

### How do I manage secrets?

Use Kubernetes secrets:
```bash
kubectl create secret generic my-secret \
  --from-literal=password=mysecretpassword
```

For production, consider:
- Sealed Secrets
- External Secrets Operator
- HashiCorp Vault

### Can I restrict who can deploy apps?

Yes! Use Kubernetes RBAC to create different user roles with limited permissions.

### How do I audit access?

1. Kubernetes audit logs (enabled by default)
2. Grafana access logs
3. ArgoCD activity logs
4. VPS access logs (SSH, Traefik)

## Scaling Questions

### When should I add a second node?

Add a second node when:
- CPU usage > 70% sustained
- RAM usage > 80%
- Need redundancy for production apps
- Want to deploy more apps

### How do I add a worker node?

```bash
# On new node
sudo ./scripts/add-worker-node.sh
```

That's it! The script handles everything.

### Can I remove a node?

Yes:
```bash
# Drain node (move pods elsewhere)
kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data

# Delete node
kubectl delete node <node-name>
```

### How many nodes can I have?

K3s supports 100+ nodes. Practical limit depends on control plane resources. With your hardware, 20-30 nodes is reasonable.

### Can I have nodes in different locations?

Yes! Use Tailscale to connect nodes across cities/countries. Label them by location and use affinity rules for geo-distribution.

## Troubleshooting Questions

### Pods are stuck in Pending

**Cause:** Usually insufficient resources or PVC issues
**Solution:** Check `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` and see troubleshooting.md

### Can't access web UIs

**Cause:** Tailscale not connected or services not started
**Solution:** 
```bash
tailscale status
kubectl get svc -A | grep LoadBalancer
```

### SSL certificate not issued

**Cause:** DNS not propagated or HTTP challenge failed
**Solution:** Wait for DNS (up to 48h), check Traefik logs on VPS

### Storage volumes not attaching

**Cause:** Longhorn issues or disk full
**Solution:** Check Longhorn UI, verify disk space with `df -h`

### App not accessible from internet

**Cause:** VPS routing not configured
**Solution:** Update `/etc/traefik/dynamic/mynodeone-routes.yml` on VPS

## Maintenance Questions

### How often should I update?

- **Daily:** Check cluster health
- **Weekly:** Review monitoring, check for alerts
- **Monthly:** Update Helm charts
- **Quarterly:** Update K3s version
- **Yearly:** Review hardware/plan expansions

### How do I update K3s?

```bash
# On control plane
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION="v1.28.6+k3s1" sh -s - server

# On workers
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION="v1.28.6+k3s1" sh -
```

### How do I backup everything?

1. **etcd snapshots:** Automatic (K3s does this)
2. **Longhorn volumes:** Configure recurring backups in UI
3. **MinIO data:** Use `mc mirror` to sync elsewhere
4. **Configs:** Git repo (infrastructure as code!)

### What if I lose my control plane node completely?

1. Restore etcd from snapshot on new hardware
2. Restore Longhorn volumes from backups
3. Redeploy apps via ArgoCD

See disaster recovery section in operations.md
